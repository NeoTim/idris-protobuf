||| This module defines the FileDescriptor type.  Currently it just lists all
||| messages and enums defined in the proto.  Currently only top level
||| definitions are supported and future version will probably list all messages
||| in the file regardless of whether they are top level or not.  That is
||| because nested messages carry no extra semantic meaning for us, since
||| generated code does not generate any kind of namespaces, which must be done
||| by the user, since type providers can't generate their own names or
||| namespaces.
